I learn all this from 

  https://github.com/alexwennerberg/boxnotes2html/blob/master/boxnotes2html/boxnote.py
  
  An attribute chunk is formatted like this:

    *n[*n...]+n[|n+n]
        eg
    *4*1+1|+1
    where *n refers to an attribute to apply from the attribute pool
    and +n is a number of characters to apply that attribute to
    and |n is indicative of a line break (unclear the purpose of this)

  All numbers 'n' are encoded as base-36 integers (i.e. [0-9a-z])
  Note that a chunk may have no attributes, and can just be a character/line span, ex. "|1+1". 

Here is a regex that matches a single chunk:

  ((?:\*\w+)*)(?:\|\w+)?(\+\w+)
  
  $1 = attributes (if any), including the *'s
  $2 = number of characters, including the +

In the .boxnote JSON, the various keys of concern are:

  "atext"->"text": the text itself
  "atext"->"attribs": the attribute chunks
  "pool"->"numToAttrib": mapping from attribute numbers to styles
