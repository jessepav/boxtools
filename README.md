Some utilities useful for use with Box

The most prominent feature for most people is the ability to convert
a `.boxnote` JSON file to text, accounting for numbered and bulleted lists,
and links. (Credit for deciphering the Box Note JSON goes to `alexwennerberg`,
in his [boxnotes2html](https://github.com/alexwennerberg/boxnotes2html) Python
project).

It's ridiculous that as of this writing (Autumn 2021) Box doesn't offer
an API to retrieve the contents of a Box Note in any usable format.
