Usage: {progname} command [args...]

Configuration files are stored in $BOXTOOLS_DIR, by default ~/.boxtools

Whenever a command expects a Box Item ID, you can use a special syntax
to lookup an ID encountered in recent ls or search commands:

  =name     Do an exact match on item names
  %name     Do a substring search on item names
  ^name     Do a prefix search on item names
  name$     Do a suffix search on item names and IDs
  /re/      use the ID of the item whose name or ID is matched by the
            case-insensitive regular expression re
  s/n       The double-focus operator! It's the best. Matches an item if
            the name includes s as a substring, and the ID ends with n.
  /p/s      Matches an item if the name includes s as a substring, and
            the parent folder name includes p.

If you don't use any special syntax, then if the ID is composed of all
digits, it's treated as a numeric ID; otherwise, it's matched against
known item names case-insensitively.

The one-character id '=' refers to the most recent ID successfully used.

Also, you can define aliases for IDs in $BOXTOOLS_DIR/id-aliases.toml
Any ID entered will first be checked against these aliases.
