The offence referred to may be a neglect or denial by the youth of any attachment to his friend, despite having given him assurances that he was committed to enduring love. Hence the beauteous day which was promised, encouraging the poet to cast away the cloak of defensive secrecy. A denial of friendship appears to call forth the language of the Gospels through association of the experience with Peter's denial of Christ. This was followed by Peter's repentance and sorrow, and indeed tears, as here. Matt.26. 31-4, 74-5. Mark 14.30, Luke 22.61-2.\n\n*List one\n*List two\n*List three\n\n*Dot one\n*Dot two\n*Dot three\n\n*where\n*are you\n\n*thus\n*we have\n*stuff\n\n\n","attribs":"*4|f+hs*4+h9|1+1*4|1+1*4*2*5*3*6+1*4*7*8+8*4|1+1*4*2*5*3+1*4*7*8+8*4|1+1*4*2*5*3+1*4*7*8+a*4|1+1|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*8+7*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*8+7*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*8+9*4|1+1|1+1*4*2*5*3*6+1*4*7*8+5*4|1+1*4*2*5*3+1*4*7*8+7*4|2+2*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*8+4*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*8+7*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*8+5*4|2+2|1+1","opCount":40,"appliedAttribsCount":93,"maxAttribsOnSingleOp":5},"pool":{"numToAttrib":{"0":["author","a.4fz9s4pIrvcRKF5l"],"1":["align","left"],"2":["insertorder","first"],"3":["lmkr","1"],"4":["author","2740917"],"5":["list","number1"],"6":["start","1"],"7":["font-color-000000","true"],"8":["font-size-medium","true"],"9":["removed","true"],"10":["list","bullet1"],"11":["start","2"],"12":["list","unchecked1"]},"nextNum":13},"chatHead":-1,"publicStatus":false,"passwordHash":null,"savedRevisions":[]}
